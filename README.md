# MakeAProject

This script will simply copy a template program to the entered directory

Right now there is only a C++ with CMake and a HTML Template but more will be added. 

you can configure the template the way you like it inside the `Template` directory.

There is no Officel Realese for this right now.

To run the script enter: `makeCProject.sh "typ of template" "name of the project" "directory"`

Keep in mind that right now the script will only rename the folder.
